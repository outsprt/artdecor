# AGENTS Instructions

This repository uses a minimal setup with static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Testing**: Run `npm test` after any change. The test script currently outputs a message and exits with code 0.
- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for HTML, CSS, and JS files.
- **Commit style**: Provide clear commit messages summarizing the change. Do not amend previous commits.
- **File structure**: Keep code organized in the existing folders. Do not introduce build systems or frameworks.
- **Accessibility**: Follow basic a11y practices (semantic HTML, alt attributes, ARIA labels where needed).
